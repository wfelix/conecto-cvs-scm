# CVS for Visual Studio Code by Conecto

The extension provides CVS (Concurrent Versions System) support to VS Code. CVS is an older Source Control Management (SCM) system. The extension integrates CVS into VS Code's SCM interface for a familar user experience such as git.

## Features

The extenstioin will automatically activate when it detects source code managed by CVS. It provides the following features:
- Add new file or folder to the repository:
- Remove file from repository:
- Commit changes to the repository:
- Merge changes from the repository into local copy
- Discard local changes and revert to the repository revision.
- View diffs between locally modifed file and repository revision.
- Display branch and revision number of file opened in active editor.

## Source Control States

![alt text](resources/images/resourceStates.png "CVS Resource States")

The following describes the possible states for a source control resource:

- `M  (Staged Changes/Changes) Locally Modifed`
- `A  (Staged Changes/Changes) Locally Added`
- `R  (Staged Changes/Changes) Locally Removed`
- `D  (Changes) Locally Deleted`
- `R  (Repository Changes) Removed from repository`
- `F  (Repository Changes) Folder found in repository`
- `M  (Repository Changes) Needs Merge with repository`
- `NC (Conflicts) Needs Checkout from repository`
- `P  (Repository Changes) Needs Patch from repository`
- `C  (Conflicts) File had conflicts on merge`
- `U  (Untracked) Resource is not part of source control`

### Staged Changes

Changes to be included in a commit must be staged. However, unlike git, additonal changes made to a staged item will not display under `Changes`. Think of `Staged Changes` as a collection of changed source control items that are selected for the next commit.
### Repository Changes

 To check for remote changes use the `Refresh Repository` icon. Remote changes detected by the extension are displayed here.
 
### Conflicts

Changes that require user intervention to solve merge conflicts are listed in `Conflicts`.
